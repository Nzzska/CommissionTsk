How to run this script

Open this directory in command line and type:

>php script.php [.csv file directory]

I left input.csv in this directory, for testing purposes, so you can run:

>php script.php input.csv

How to initiate tests.

>composer run test

I put a lot of effort to make code easily readable, however I added comments for
messiest parts, which I would find a little confusing myself. 

Also I added a diagram of the flow of this program (JPEG in this directory).
